# OHLC Candlestick Data and Price Patterns

This repository is dedicated to the analysis of OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) candlestick data and the exploration of price patterns in financial markets. By studying these patterns, we aim to provide insights that can assist traders and analysts in making more informed decisions.

## Project Overview

Candlestick charts are a fundamental tool in technical analysis, used by traders to visualize price movements of financial assets over specific time periods. Each candlestick encapsulates four critical data points: the opening price, the highest price, the lowest price, and the closing price within a given time frame. These charts not only depict price trends but also reveal potential future movements through distinct patterns.

### Candlestick Patterns

In this project, we delve into the identification and analysis of various candlestick patterns that serve as indicators of potential market behavior:

- **Doji**: A pattern where the open and close prices are nearly identical, indicating market indecision.
- **Hammer**: A bullish reversal pattern that suggests a potential price increase after a downtrend.
- **Engulfing**: A reversal pattern where one candlestick completely engulfs the previous one, signaling a possible change in trend.
- **Morning Star**: A bullish pattern that predicts the beginning of an upward trend.
- **Evening Star**: A bearish counterpart to the Morning Star, indicating the start of a downward trend.

These patterns are key to understanding market sentiment and predicting future price movements.

## Word2Vec Algorithm

The **Word2Vec** algorithm, originally developed for natural language processing, is applied in this project to model sequences of price movements. By converting these sequences into vector representations, the algorithm captures the underlying relationships between different price patterns.

### How Word2Vec Enhances Pattern Recognition

- **Semantic Similarity**: Word2Vec allows us to measure the similarity between different price sequences, much like it does with words in a sentence. This helps in identifying patterns that may not be immediately obvious.
- **Predictive Power**: The vector embeddings generated by Word2Vec can be used as inputs to predictive models, improving their accuracy in forecasting future price movements based on historical data.

By combining traditional technical analysis with advanced machine learning techniques like Word2Vec, this project aims to push the boundaries of pattern recognition in financial markets.
